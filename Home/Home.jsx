                    <p class="pere">These curated galleries feature my fine art landscape & nature photography from travels over the past twenty years. I specialize in creating beautiful images of the natural environment including mountains, wilderness areas and gardens. My adventures have taken me to many places including California, Utah, Colorado and Italy. I offer limited and open edition photography prints on ready-to-hang TruLife® Acrylic face mounts and ChromaLuxe Edge Mounts. Canson Infinity Platine Fibre watercolor prints are also available if you wish to work with your own framer.</p>
